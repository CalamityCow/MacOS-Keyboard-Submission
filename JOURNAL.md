- 100% mechanical keyboard
- Hot swappable
- LCD(probably to save cost) screen display
- 2 USB 3.0
- 2 USB C
- 1 microSD reader
- 1 ethernet port

I'd like to have an aluminum case for my keyboard but since it will likely have to be custom, I'm not too sure how to machine one. (Also it seems that nobody sells 100% shells anyways)
