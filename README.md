# MacOS-Keyboard-Submission

This project is just a simple MacOS keyboard, although honestly you can modify any keyboard to beomce a MacOS keyboard by changing its firmware. 
I started this project because I thought it would be fun to learn how to design a PCB and solder electronic components. I started with project with a template from ScottoKeebs, which included the MCU and the power supply prewired.
## Features
The main features of this keyboard are:
- 95 keys
- 6 macro keys
- 101 per-key leds
- volume knob

Later on I want to try to add a LCD screen to the keyboard and some hubs.

# PCB and Schematic
The PCB and schematic were designed using KiCad. It is a standard 2 layer design.
